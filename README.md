# BlockChainJ

Simple blockchain implementation, in Java, WIP

## Description

This blockchain implementation has:

- Block: with number, parent block and list of transactions
- Transaction: send value from sender to receiver account
- Account: with balance and optional smart contract code
- Virtual Machine: to execute smart contracts

The world state keeps the account states. Each account has a balance and smart contract storage.

## To Do

- Coin type
- Signed transactions
- DataWord or Coin in Transaction value, instead of BigInteger
- DataWord or Coin in Account balance, instead of BigInteger
- Block JSON serialization
- Block transaction hash should be the hash of a trie
- Difficulty in block
- Total difficulty in block JSON serialization
- Numeric values in hexadecimal in JSON serialization
- Transaction receipts
- Log emit
- Create contracts
- Call contracts in Virtual Machine
